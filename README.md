## Abstract
Underwater image restoration is a critical research area in computer vision, owing to its inherent complexities and diverse applications in challenging environments. Conventional approaches often fall short in achieving satisfactory results due to insufficient integration of features from both frequency and spatial domains. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a Mamba-enhanced Spectral-Attentive Wavelet Network (MESA-WNet) for effective underwater image recovery. The proposed method comprises three pivotal modules: a spatial detail enhancement encoder, a state-space model for local information compensation, and a spectral cross-attention residual module. The spatial detail enhancement encoder utilizes differential convolution and Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) to refine average coefficients post-wavelet transform, ensuring precise detail restoration. The state-space model for local information compensation leverages Two-Dimensional Selective Scanning (SS2D) to dynamically integrate multi-scale data, enhancing global context understanding. The spectral cross-attention residual module focuses on optimizing high-frequency component recovery through Fourier feature extraction and adaptive convolution, thereby improving both spectral and spatial fidelity. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method excels in underwater image recovery tasks, outperforming existing state-of-the-art techniques and showcasing significant potential for practical applications.
